        Siruvani Waterfalls, located about 35 km from Coimbatore, is one of the most beautiful natural attractions in Tamil Nadu. Nestled in the Western Ghats, it is renowned for its crystal-clear water and lush green surroundings. The waterfall is a part of the Siruvani Hills, and the water flows from the Siruvani River, which is also the source of drinking water for Coimbatore. Interestingly, Siruvani water is known to be one of the tastiest natural waters due to its high mineral content and unique sweetness.

The water tumbles down from rocky formations, forming a small pool where visitors can take a refreshing dip. The entire area is rich in biodiversity, with rare species of flora and fauna.
