 # 🌍 Explore Edge

Explore Edge is a travel planning website designed to help users explore popular destinations, view details, and add them to a cart for easy planning. The site is lightweight and built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized into several sections. It begins with a main homepage and an about page. Destination-specific pages are grouped together in one section, while another section is dedicated to thematic categories such as adventure, temples, and hill stations. A separate section manages the cart and trip planning features. All images, icons, and media resources are placed in a dedicated assets section. The design and layout are handled through a styles section, and interactive functionality is managed through a scripts section. The overall documentation is maintained in a separate documentation file.
