Deity: Lord Shiva (Eswaran) <br>
Built by: 9th Century <br>

Located in the heart of Coimbatore, Kottai Eswaran Temple is one of the oldest temples in the region. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, this temple is historically significant as it was built during the reign of the Cholas. The temple is famous for its unique Linga representation, which is believed to have divine powers.

The temple features classic Dravidian-style architecture with beautifully sculpted pillars, a massive entrance tower, and a sacred water tank. The temple is surrounded by a strong fort-like structure, which is why it is called "Kottai" (meaning "fort" in Tamil).

The annual Maha Shivaratri festival is celebrated with great enthusiasm here, with devotees staying awake all night, chanting hymns, and performing rituals. Another special feature of this temple is the Navagraha Shrine, where devotees perform special poojas to reduce planetary doshas (astrological afflictions).
