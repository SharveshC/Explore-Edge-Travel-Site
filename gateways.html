        Isha Yoga Center is one of the most prominent spiritual retreats in India, located about 30 km from Coimbatore at the foothills of the Velliangiri Hills. Founded by Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev, this globally recognized center is designed for spiritual growth, meditation, and holistic well-being. The most famous landmark is the 112-foot Adiyogi Shiva statue, which holds the Guinness World Record for the world’s largest bust statue. The statue represents Shiva as the first yogi (Adi Yogi) and attracts thousands of visitors annually, especially during the Mahashivratri festival, when the entire complex comes alive with meditation sessions, cultural performances, and spiritual discourses.

Inside the center, the Dhyanalinga is an extraordinary meditation space, radiating spiritual energy and welcoming people of all backgrounds. The Linga Bhairavi temple, dedicated to the divine feminine, provides a contrasting yet complementary energy to the spiritual experience. Visitors can also experience guided yoga sessions, energy healing, Ayurvedic therapies, and detox programs.

The center follows sustainable living practices, with eco-friendly accommodations, organic farming, and solar energy initiatives. The natural beauty of the surroundings—lush green landscapes, bird songs, and a gentle mountain breeze—enhances the sense of peace and tranquility. A visit to Isha Yoga Center is perfect for those seeking relaxation, meditation, or a deep dive into the spiritual way of life.

If you want to enjoy the rustic charm of the countryside, do not miss visiting Mangarai, a hamlet at the foothills of Anaikatti. The small village is surrounded by coconut groves and brick kilns. The ‘kaapi’ or coffee in this place is special for its blend of sweet and spice by adding dry ginger and jaggery. People often have steamed legumes mixed with coconut and legumes with this coffee. The Anuvavi Subramanya Temple and The Lalithambikai Temple are two temples that are famous in Mangarai.
