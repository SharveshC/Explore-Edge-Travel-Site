        Imagine unwinding in a picturesque village blessed with the beauty of all elements of nature like the gushing streams, jaw-dropping waterfalls, verdant hills and rich forest life. The village of Annaikatti, situated 30 meters away from Coimbatore offers you nothing less than a splendid and tranquil experience!
Anaikatti, meaning a group of elephants, offers you to experience the natural beauty of the Western Ghats. The village is also home to the Siruvani river, which UNESCO has certified to have the second sweetest water in the world. You can embark on a night safari through Anaikatti forest where animals like elephants, mongooses and the Indian bison can be spotted. It is advisable to maintain silence during the trip as the sound may disturb the animals. Also, during the day, you can enjoy the beauty of rainforests. The silent valley national park in the village is one of the last explored rainforests in the country. It also has a mythological connection as it is believed that Pandavas during their exile had visited the forest and it is also known by the name Sairandhri Vanam, another name of Draupadi and the river nearby is called Kunthipuzha, named after Kunthi. Jeeps are available for hire to enjoy the rare flora and fauna of the place.


If you want to enjoy the rustic charm of the countryside, do not miss visiting Mangarai, a hamlet at the foothills of Anaikatti. The small village is surrounded by coconut groves and brick kilns. The ‘kaapi’ or coffee in this place is special for its blend of sweet and spice by adding dry ginger and jaggery. People often have steamed legumes mixed with coconut and legumes with this coffee. The Anuvavi Subramanya Temple and The Lalithambikai Temple are two temples that are famous in Mangarai. 

To know more about the ecosystem, and nature conservation, visit the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (SACON) and Nilgiri Biosphere Nature Park. There are also elaichi (cardamom), coffee and pepper plantations which you can visit through off-road rides. The Arsha Vidya Gurukulam provides you insights into Vedas, Upanishads and other ancient texts.
