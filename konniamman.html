Koniamman Temple is one of the most famous and powerful temples dedicated to Goddess Koniamman, an incarnation of Goddess Parvati. The temple is believed to have been established during the rule of the Kongu Cholas and has been a major spiritual center for centuries.

This temple is known for its grand gopuram, colorful sculptures, and intricately designed sanctum. The idol of Koniamman is depicted in a seated posture with a divine aura, believed to bless devotees with prosperity, health, and well-being.

The most significant festival celebrated here is the "Panguni Uthiram," when thousands of devotees undertake a spiritual walk (padayatra) to the temple. The temple is also famous for fire-walking ceremonies, where devotees express their devotion by walking barefoot on burning embers.

The temple is particularly crowded during Navaratri, when it is beautifully decorated with flowers and lights, and special poojas are performed. Many business owners and entrepreneurs visit this temple to seek blessings for financial success and growth.
