        Location: Perur, Coimbatore <br>
        Deity: Lord Shiva (Pateeswarar) <br>
        Built by: Karikala Chola (2nd Century AD) <br>
        
        One of the oldest and most revered temples in Coimbatore, Perur Pateeswarar Temple is a magnificent shrine dedicated to Lord Shiva. This temple is believed to have been built by the Chola dynasty over 1,500 years ago and later expanded by the Nayaks and Vijayanagar rulers. The temple is known for its exquisite stone carvings, particularly in the Kanaka Sabha (Golden Hall), which features breathtaking sculptures depicting Hindu mythology and celestial beings.
        
        The temple’s main deity, Pateeswarar, is a self-manifested (Swayambhu) Shiva Lingam, making it a highly sacred site for devotees. The temple also houses Goddess Pachainayaki, the consort of Lord Shiva. The intricate Dravidian-style architecture, detailed sculptures, and ancient inscriptions found in the temple narrate stories from history and epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata.
        
        A major highlight of this temple is the Arudra Darshan festival, celebrated with grandeur, attracting thousands of devotees. The temple is also known for its Theerthavari festival, during which Lord Shiva’s idol is taken in a grand procession to the nearby river for a ceremonial bath.
