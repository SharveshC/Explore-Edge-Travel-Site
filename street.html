        Oppanakara Street is Coimbatore’s busiest shopping hub, known for its wholesale textile markets, budget-friendly jewelry stores, and household goods outlets. This historical shopping street has been a trade center for over 100 years, attracting both local buyers and business owners.

The street is lined with over 500 shops, selling cotton sarees, silk fabrics, dress materials, readymade garments, and ethnic wear at wholesale prices. Many shopkeepers source textiles directly from handloom manufacturers, ensuring authentic quality at lower prices.

Apart from textiles, Oppanakara Street is also home to gold and silver jewelry stores, where shoppers can find traditional Tamil-style ornaments, temple jewelry, and modern designs at competitive rates. The street also has shops specializing in footwear, handbags, home appliances, and decorative items.

Bargaining is an essential skill here, as shopkeepers expect customers to negotiate prices. Street vendors selling hot samosas, fruit juices, and local snacks make shopping here even more enjoyable.

If you love street shopping and exploring local markets, Oppanakara Street is a must-visit destination in Coimbatore.
